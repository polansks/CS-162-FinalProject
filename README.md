# CS-162-FinalProject
Final project for CS 162 - Introduction to Computer Science II

This was the final project for my CS 162 class from the fall 2017 quarter. We had to design a text-based game using a
space structure (i.e. moving from one space to another space) with requirements that implemented the use of most of 
the concepts we learned throughout the course.

A description of the project requirements is provided in "Project Requirements.pdf"

The concept I chose was of a scientist in a lab having accidentally spilled acid in his/her eyes. The user must move
around the lab--blinded because of the acid--and try to find either an emergency shower to wash their eyes with, a
cell phone to call for help, or 2 units of hydrogen and 1 unit of oxygen in order to make their own water to wash
the acid out with.  The user has a limited amount of time in which to do this before they run out of time, become
permanently blinded and lose the game.
