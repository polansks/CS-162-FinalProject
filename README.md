# CS-162-FinalProject
Final project for CS 162 - Introduction to Computer Science II

This was the final project for my CS 162 class from the fall 2017 quarter. We had to design a text-based game using a
space structure (i.e. moving from one space to another space) with requirements that required us to implement most of 
the concepts we learned throughout the course.

A description of the project requirements is provided in "Project Requirements.pdf"

The concept I chose was of a scientist in a lab having accidentally spilled acid in his/her eyes. The user must move
around the lab--blinded because of the acid--and try to find either an emergency shower to wash their eyes with, a
cell phone to call for help, or 2 units of hydrogen and 1 unit of oxygen in order to make their own water to wash
the acid out with.  There are tables in the lab that, due to the temporary blidness of the player, only become visible
once the user has run into them. There is a limited amount of time for the user to save their sight using one of the
three methods before becoming permanently blinded and losing the game.
